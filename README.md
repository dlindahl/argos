#### Why Argos?

I wanted a cool name that somehow related to tagging. So I though of the tagging of animals to track migration patterns.
A quick Wikipedia search led me to a satellite named [ARGOS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argos_System) that tracks environmental data and animal behavior.

Its probably a bit of a stretch, but what Gem names aren't these days?
